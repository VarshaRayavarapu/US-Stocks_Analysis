Title: Predicting Stock Performance Using Financial Ratios (2014–2018)

Description:
This project uses financial data of U.S. companies (2014–2018) to predict stock performance. It includes thorough data preprocessing, classification models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), and regression modeling (Random Forest Regressor) to understand and evaluate stock movement patterns. The goal is to explore whether financial ratios can classify a stock as good/bad or predict future price variance.
